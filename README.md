### HOOP! 🤘🏾

My name is Edilson Pacheco. Currently i'm living in São Paulo, Brazil and working with front-end development. Since i've been learned to write my first functional line of code, i turn myself a lover of technologies and all ecosystem wrapped around them.
I like to play drums and guitar, it's a nice therapy! 🎸🥁
My heros is Jesus, my father, Spider-Man (Peter Parker) and Jimi Hendrix, that's all! ✌🏾 🙌🏾
